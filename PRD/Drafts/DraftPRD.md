# CourseLLM - Draft PRD

## Vision
To create an AI-enhanced learning platform that helps CS students better understand and master course materials while ensuring they engage deeply with the content rather than using AI as a shortcut.

## High-Level Concepts

### 1. Socratic Learning AI Assistant
- AI tutor that guides through discovery rather than providing direct answers
- Validates understanding before advancing topics
- Keeps discussions focused on course materials
- Adapts to student's current knowledge level

### 2. Course Material Management
- Teacher-controlled content repository
- RAG-based indexing and retrieval
- Structured learning paths (trajectories)
- Content consistency validation

### 3. Progress Tracking & Analytics
- Student mastery monitoring
- Knowledge gap identification
- Learning trajectory optimization
- Class-wide progress insights

### 4. Learning Enhancement Tools
- Personalized quiz generation
- Assignment assistance
- Technical environment setup help
- Resource recommendations

## Key Differentiators
1. **Course-Specific Scope**: Unlike general AI tools, focuses exclusively on approved course materials
2. **Learning-First Approach**: Prevents AI from being used to bypass learning
3. **Progress Tracking**: Monitors and guides student learning trajectories
4. **Teacher Control**: Gives educators full control over content and learning paths

## Open Questions & Ideas

### Teaching Enhancement
- How to best structure learning trajectories?
- What metrics best indicate student understanding?
- How to handle prerequisites across courses?

### Technical Considerations
- Best approaches for RAG implementation with course materials
- Methods for detecting and handling out-of-scope queries
- Integration with existing university systems

### Student Experience
- Balance between guidance and challenge
- Maintaining engagement in Socratic dialogue
- Handling varying student skill levels

## Next Steps
1. Define detailed user stories and acceptance criteria
2. Create data model for course materials and learning trajectories
3. Design RAG architecture for course content
4. Develop student progress tracking metrics
5. Create prototype of Socratic dialogue system
